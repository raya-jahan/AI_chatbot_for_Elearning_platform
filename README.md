Interactive Chat Interface: Allows users to type queries and receive AI-generated responses.
AI-Powered Backend: Utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library with pre-trained models like FLAN-T5 for natural language generation.
Lightweight and Modular Design: Built using Flask for the backend and simple HTML/JavaScript for the frontend.
Cross-Origin Compatibility: Integrated CORS to ensure smooth communication between frontend and backend.
Customizable Responses: Easily switch or fine-tune the model for domain-specific tasks.

Technologies Used

Python: Backend programming language
Flask: Web framework for the backend
Hugging Face Transformers: NLP library for generating responses
HTML/JavaScript: Frontend for user interaction
CORS: Middleware for cross-origin resource sharing

Example Interaction

User Input:
"What is machine learning?"

Chatbot Response:

"Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating systems that learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."

Future Enhancements
